**Future Enhancement**
With more efficiency in the the future here are some features I would like to implement into the app.

1. Ability to add more playlists
2. Ability to view the song information from an external API Call
3. Ability to drag and drop tracks within the playlist to order them as you see fit
4. Full interactivy with the ability to share your playlist with friends
This app has the potential to be a a full music information and playlist app returning information to the user about the song and show other interesting information such as treanding music.
